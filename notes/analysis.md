Passing: 
    Do winning teams just throw more or do they throw more efficiently?

        * Teams tend to pass slightly less in wins, however the total passing yards are all higher in wins. Effiency is higher in wins and some measures there is a hge difference. In wins, the average qb rating, which is a stat that measures overall qb effeciency, is about 24 points higher than in losses. There are also positive differences in completion percentage, Y/A, and Y/C. Wins in the NFC South come more frequently when teams take care of the football in the passing game, not necessarily when they are super aggresive.

    Is completion percentage or yards-per-atempt more predictive of wins?

        * It seems completion percentage is a stronger factor in wins becaue their is a higher difference in wins than Y/A. Teams average close to 5 percentage points higher in completion percentage in wins over losses and only about 2 more Y/A in wins over losses, though that is still a significant margin. Winning teams focus more on making the completion, likely to keep the clock going, than to get a few extra yards on each play.

    Do losses tend to have empty passing stats?

        * Losses having empty stats may be a stretch considering when a team is losing they generally being passing more especially more chunk yardage plays since they need to get down the field quick to score and if they throw an incompletion they do not lose any yards and only a few seconds of game clock. However, from the data shows that losing teams tend to lean more on passing and thus become less efficient in the passing game which can be argued as empty stats. 

Rusing:
    Do wins have more attempts or yard-per-carry than losses?

        * Winning teams average more attempts and have a higher percentage of rush plays, however, they do not consistently have a higher percentage of scores from runs, showing that teams likely establish the run game in order to gain control of their drives instead of leaning on the run game to score. The data shows that in wins vs losses the amount of rushing tds do not change much. The Bucs have an interesting stat, being the only team that has less total ruhing yards in wins suggesting that they rely more on passing efficiency in wins, compared to the Falcons and Panthers who average 47 and 60 more yards in wins than in losses. Teams rely on the run game to establish their offensive gameplan but do not neccesarily rely on the run game to score and use their passing efficiency to create a balanced offense to win games. 

    Do teams abandon the run in losses?
    
        * When looking at the data almost all teams seem to "abandon" the run in losses, which is generally the gameplan for most teams. As stated earlier, teams attempt more passes and less rushes in games that they lost, suggesting that they begin to throw the ball more in order to save game clock and get more chunk yardage plays.
