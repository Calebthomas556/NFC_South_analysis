Passing: 
    Do winning teams just throw more or do they throw more efficiently?

        * Teams tend to pass slightly less in wins, however the total passing yards are all higher in wins. Effiency is higher in wins and some measures there is a hge difference. In wins, the average qb rating, which is a stat that measures overall qb effeciency, is about 24 points higher than in losses. There are also positive differences in completion percentage, Y/A, and Y/C. Wins in the NFC South come more frequently when teams take care of the football in the passing game, not necessarily when they are super aggresive.

    Is completion percentage or yards-per-atempt more predictive of wins?

        * It seems completion percentage is a stronger factor in wins becaue their is a higher difference in wins than Y/A. Teams average close to 5 percentage points higher in completion percentage in wins over losses and only about 2 more Y/A in wins over losses, though that is still a significant margin. Winning teams focus more on making the completion, likely to keep the clock going, than to get a few extra yards on each play.

    Do losses tend to have empty passing stats?

        * Losses having empty stats may be a stretch considering when a team is losing they generally being passing more especially more chunk yardage plays since they need to get down the field quick to score and if they throw an incompletion they do not lose any yards and only a few seconds of game clock. However, from the data shows that losing teams tend to lean more on passing and thus become less efficient in the passing game which can be argued as empty stats. 

Rusing:
    Do wins have more attempts or yard-per-carry than losses?

        * Winning teams average more attempts and have a higher percentage of rush plays, however, they do not consistently have a higher percentage of scores from runs, showing that teams likely establish the run game in order to gain control of their drives instead of leaning on the run game to score. The data shows that in wins vs losses the amount of rushing tds do not change much. The Bucs have an interesting stat, being the only team that has less total ruhing yards in wins suggesting that they rely more on passing efficiency in wins, compared to the Falcons and Panthers who average 47 and 60 more yards in wins than in losses. Teams rely on the run game to establish their offensive gameplan but do not neccesarily rely on the run game to score and use their passing efficiency to create a balanced offense to win games. 

    Do teams abandon the run in losses?
    
        * When looking at the data almost all teams seem to "abandon" the run in losses, which is generally the gameplan for most teams. As stated earlier, teams attempt more passes and less rushes in games that they lost, suggesting that they begin to throw the ball more in order to save game clock and get more chunk yardage plays. 

Special Teams:
    Is poor field goal execution losing games?
    
        * Three of four teams in the NFC south showed field goals account for a smaller share of total scores in losses. Also, three of four teams have a higher accuracy of field goals in wins. This suggests that teams are not primarily losing games due to missed field goals. This also points towards the teams lack of success in sustaining drives and getting into field goal range rather than the inability to finsh drives once in scoring range. However, this data says more about the teams offensive consistency rather than special teams performance.

    Are close losses associated with missed field goals?

        * Each NFC South team experienced at least one close loss (defined as a loss by three points or fewer) in which a field goal was missed. The Panthers and Falcons each missed a field goal in half of their close losses, indicating that special teams execution plausibly influenced the outcome in those games. The Saints recorded only one close loss with a missed field goal, while the Buccaneers missed one field goal across their three close losses. This suggests that while broader offensive and defensive factors drive season-long success, special teams execution can be decisive in close games. In a tightly contested division, where three teams finished tied for the best record, these special teams errors likely played a meaningful role in shaping playoff positioning. 

Sloppy Play:

    Are teams playing more disciplined in wins?

        * Surprisingly, teams are committing more penalties in wins than in losses. Teams are also averaging a lot more penalties in big wins and big losses than in close losses and close wins, suggesting that teams are playing more disciplined in close games and start to play sloppier once they are up big or down big. In the NFC South teams are averaging more penalties, penalty yards, penalty yards per play, and penalty yards per yard in wins than in losses. Without more in-depth penalty data, like types of penalties and when the penalties occur, it is hard to say that teams play more disciplined in wins than in losses or vice versa. Another small takeaway from this data is that the Falcons average about 10 yards per penalty in losses and less than 7 in wins, suggesting that penalties could be effecting them a bit more in losses than other teams.

    What does the sack and turnover gap in wins vs. losses suggest?

        * Without surprise each team averages more total turnovers, interceptions, and fumbles lost in losses than in wins. Turnovers are the worst way to end a drive because it not only ends your offense with no point but usually sets up the opposing team with good field positioning. In wins, the Falcons and Panthers averaged more sacks allowed than in losses while the Bucs and Saints both allowed over .5 more sacks in losses. The Falcons were the only team to lose more yards due to sacks in wins than in losses. This analysis, paired with the penalty analysis, suggest that when the Falcons play a "cleaner" it does not neccessarily translate to wins.

Defense:

    Disrupting Pass or Run more predictive of wins?

        * In losses vs. wins, ech team performed as expected on defense. Opponent rushing volume is up in losses, likely due to running the ball more to burn game clock. However, rushing efficiency is not as consistent. Saints and Falcons allow slightly less yds per carry in losses while the Panthers and Bucs are the opposite. For the Falcons, the data suggested disrupting the run might have led to wins more clearly than the other three teams. Passing defense was as expected as well. Passing attempts and yards down in losses but efficiency up. The saints had the biggest gap in passing defense performance in wins and losses, suggesting that disrupting the pass game might be more effective in getting wins.

    How effective are sacks in wins vs. losses?

        * The panthers are the only team to average more sacks in losses than in wins, but each team averaged more total sack yards and sack yards per play in wins. The difference in teams ability to get sacks and how effective they are in wins vs losses is significant but not enough to say that getting more sacks leads to wins. Getting a sack is going to help get a win and we see that throgh the numbers.  

Down Play:

    Wins correlate with total first downs or conversion percentage?

        * Teams in the NFC south do not have a significant difference in total first downs in wins vs losses, with the Bucs actually having more in losses. On the other hand, each teams 3rd down covnersion rate is significantly higher in wins and the 4th down conversion rate is almost double in wins for each team.

    Are penalties skewing first down numbers in losses?

        * Yes. Each team averages close to double first downs gained by penalties in losses compared to wins, suggestint that opponents likely play less disciplined when up. 

    Does being aggresive on 4th correlate to wins?

        * Panthers are the only team that averages less 4th down attempts in losses. In late game situations teams usually wil go for it on 4th down when trailing so these are expected numbers. However, the conversion rates for each of these teams on 4th down are up significantly higher in wins. Finding a way to efficienty convert 4th downs may be a factor in getting wins.
